# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro Timer built using Python and Tkinter. This application helps users manage their time efficiently by implementing the Pomodoro technique, which consists of alternating work and break intervals.

## Features
- **25-minute work sessions** followed by **10-minute short breaks**.
- **20-minute long break** after every 4 work sessions.
- Automatic session tracking with checkmarks.
- Simple and intuitive UI with a **Start** and **Reset** button.

## Installation
To run the Pomodoro Timer, ensure you have Python installed on your system.

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the script.
2. Install Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python).
3. Place a `tomato.png` image in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Click the **Start** button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
- The timer will automatically switch between work and break sessions.
- A checkmark (âœ”) appears after each completed work session.
- Click **Reset** at any time to restart the timer.

## Dependencies
This project only requires Python's built-in `tkinter` module, so no additional libraries are needed.
